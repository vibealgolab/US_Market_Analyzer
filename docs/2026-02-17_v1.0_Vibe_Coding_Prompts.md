**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Author:** VibeAlgoLab

## 1. Overview
This is a collection of **core prompts** to reproduce this project using only AI (Gemini, Claude, GPT) without source code. Copy and adapt these prompts for each feature implementation.

## 2. Feature-Specific Prompts
### A. Dashboard Layout
> "Create a Next.js dashboard layout using Tailwind CSS. The theme should be 'Dark Premium Fintech'. Use `bg-zinc-950` as the background. Include a sidebar navigation and a main content area with a responsive grid system. The design should look professional, utilizing glassmorphism effects for cards."

### B. RichText Component (AI Report)
> "I need a React component named `RichText` that renders markdown-like text. It should handle parsed AI output, where headers start with `###` and bold text is wrapped in `**`. 
> - Headers (`###`): Render as `h3` with `font-bold` and separate spacing.
> - Bold (`**`): Render as `strong` with `text-zinc-100`.
> - Body: Render as `p` with `text-zinc-400`.
> Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure readability on a dark background."

### C. Correlation Heatmap
> "Create a `CorrelationHeatmap` component. It should take a correlation matrix as input props. 
> - Render a grid of `div`s representing the matrix.
> - Color the cells based on value: Positive (Indigo), Negative (Rose). Opacity should match the correlation strength.
> - Add a tooltip on hover showing the ticker pair and the exact value.
> - Use standard Tailwind colors and ensure the layout is responsive."

### D. Data Pipeline (Python Script)
> "Write a Python script `macro_analyzer.py` that fetches S&P 500 data using `yfinance`. 
> - Calculate the daily percentage change.
> - Use Google Gemini API to generate a summary of today's market trend.
> - Save the result as `macro_analysis.json` in a `data` folder.
> - Ensure error handling for API failures."

## 3. Style Guide Prompt
> "Apply a 'Zinc & Indigo' color scheme. 
> - Backgrounds: `zinc-950` to `zinc-900`.
> - Borders: `zinc-800`.
> - Primary Actions: `indigo-600` hover `indigo-500`.
> - Text: `zinc-100` for headings, `zinc-400` for body.
> Use `lucide-react` for icons."
