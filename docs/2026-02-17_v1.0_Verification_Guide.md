# Verification & Quality Assurance Guide (v1.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Author:** VibeAlgoLab

## 1. Overview
This document defines the procedures to verify that the output generated by Vibe Coding works as intended. It focuses on validating the consistency between **AI-generated data** and **UI rendering**.

## 2. Data Verification
### A. JSON Validity Check
Verify file generation in the `data/` folder after running `macro_analyzer.py`.
- **Checklist:**
    - [ ] Is `macro_analysis.json` larger than 1KB? (Not empty)
    - [ ] Is the JSON format correct? (No Syntax Errors)
    - [ ] Does the `ai_analysis` field contain text?

### B. AI Report Quality Check
- **Checklist:**
    - [ ] Do report titles follow the `### Title` format?
    - [ ] Are unrelated markdown symbols (e.g., ```json) excluded from the body?

## 3. UI/UX Verification (Visual)
### A. Dashboard Loading State
- **Scenario:** No data available (Initial run)
- **Expected Result:** "Loading Market Data..." spinner or Skeleton UI displayed.
- **Action:** Temporarily rename `data/*.json` files to test.

### B. RichText Rendering (AI Report)
- **Scenario:** Displaying AI Report
- **Expected Result:**
    - Titles (`###`) are **Bold** and distinct from body text.
    - Emphasized (`**`) text appears **Bold** and brighter (`text-zinc-100`).
    - Line breaks are handled naturally for readability.

### C. Responsive Layout
- **Action:** Resize browser window to test.
- **Critical Points:**
    - Mobile (375px): Shifts to a 1-column layout?
    - Desktop (1440px): Maintains a 3-column grid?

## 4. Functional & Interaction Verification
### A. Correlation Heatmap
- **Action:** Hover over heatmap cells.
- **Expected Result:**
    - Tooltip appears immediately.
    - Displays "Ticker Pair", "Correlation Value", and "Interpretation" accurately.

## 5. Pre-deployment Checklist
1. Run `npm run build` to check for build errors.
2. Run `npm start` to test production mode and check error logs.
3. Run `git status` to ensure unnecessary files are excluded (`.gitignore` applied).
